# Generative Adversarial Networks
GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks) is a type of artificial intelligence algorithm introduced by Ian Goodfellow and his colleagues in 2014. GANs are a class of machine learning models designed for generative tasks, meaning they can create new data instances that resemble a given dataset.

In this Notebook, I implement a simple GAN to generate anime faces, the dataset used can be found on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/splcher/animefacedataset).
